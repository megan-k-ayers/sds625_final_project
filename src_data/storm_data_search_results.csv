As traffic backed up behind the scene, six more vehicles crashed and more than 10 left the roadway, including several semis. The highway was closed for more than four hours. Around the same time, Klamath Falls police were responding to another accident on Highway 97 just north of town, when another semi lost control and struck three police cars and a fire engine. The driver fled the scene and has not been apprehended as of the night of 12/12/20. Minutes after the first collision, another semi collided with the same fire truck, resulting in heavy damage. Oregon state police also reported numerous crashes on an icy Highway 39 near Merrill, OR (also just north of the CA/OR state line). Police reports stated nearly all involved were travelling too fast for icy road conditions. Road conditions at the time of the accident were reported to be icy due to overnight snow and ongoing freezing fog. The KLMT ASOS reported visibility of less than a quarter of a mile and freezing fog at the time of the accidents, with a temperature of 17 degrees. A Co-Op observer at Keno, OR, around the same time as and near the scene of the fatal accident, reported 2.5 of snow in the previous 24 hours, with freezing fog and a temperature of 19 degrees at the time of observation.|Highway 97 was closed for over 4 hours.
