#' # Introduction
#' \subsection{Contextualizing and motivating}
#' Climate change and environmental degradation is one of the most existential
#' crises of our time, if not the most existential. Unfortunately, many
#' Americans do not agree with this statement and/or do not fully comprehend the
#' implications of our global future if we do not address the causes of
#' climate change. Without recognition of the seriousness of climate change,
#' harmful consumer habits perpetuate, eco-friendly policies falter due to lack
#' of support, and the industries and corporations that negatively impact the
#' environment are not held accountable nor pressured to abandon the status quo.
#' Climate communication is a field that works with these issues, and in
#' particular, with how to educate and persuade individuals about climate
#' change and the necessity of acting to reduce it. The hope is that
#' the more people there are that recognize climate change as a serious threat,
#' the more likely we are to have politicians and corporations that are
#' pressured to use their positions of power to enact positive change when it
#' comes to the environment. 
#' 
#' This contextualizes my goal for this final project - to better understand
#' some aspects of climate change beliefs at the county-level. If we don't 
#' understand the beliefs that people currently have about climate change,
#' and what factors might influence those beliefs, then we will be less
#' effective at trying to persuade those people than if we can be understanding
#' and empathetic at the same time as being convincing. In particular I am
#' curious to see how local extreme weather events relate to county-level
#' climate change beliefs. I would expect that personally experiencing one of
#' the widely broadcasted affects of climate change - increased extreme weather
#' events such as drought, hurricanes, wildfires, winter storms, etc - would
#' cause a person to take climate change more seriously, compared to someone
#' who just hears about these things happening on the news. However, there are
#' other cultural and demographic factors that I would expect to have an effect
#' on climate change opinions that also need to be controlled for, such as
#' political leanings and age.
#'

#' \subsection{Data sources}
#' To explore the relationship between extreme weather events and climate
#' change opinion with consideration given to the additional impact of
#' political leanings and demographics on climate change beliefs, I gathered
#' information from multiple data sources. To attempt to understand climate
#' change beliefs, which I will consider to be the response variable, I
#' will use data collected and processed by the Yale Program on Climate Change
#' Communication. This data consists of US county-level estimates of climate
#' change beliefs, i.e. x% of the population in New Haven County believes that
#' climate change is happening. These estimates are calculated from a
#' large-scale nation-wide survey (n > 25,000) conducted in 2020, and were
#' "derived from a statistical model using multilevel regression with
#' post-stratification (MRP)" While individual-level data may be more powerful
#' for arguing existence of a causal relationship between extreme weather
#' event experiences and climate change beliefs, actually obtaining the
#' supplementary data at this level was not feasible for this project due to
#' data privacy issues and the fact that it is difficult to guarantee that an
#' individual experienced an extreme weather event, even if they are recorded
#' as living in the county where one occurred.
#' 
#' \textcolor{red}{Need to add more about the other datasets.}
#' 
#' Note that individual level data may be preferable but I just have county
#' level for now.
